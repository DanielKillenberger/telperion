# fn-9-real-species-profiles-and-procedural.9 Run cross-seed visual QA and document the species workflow

## Description
Run cross-seed visual QA and document the species workflow. See the parent spec for the botanical target and validation contract.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `tests/browser/species.mjs`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `tests/migration/README.md`, `.flow/evidence/fn9/REPORT.md`
**Touches:** [tests/browser/species.mjs, package.json, README.md, tests/migration/README.md, .flow/evidence/fn9/REPORT.md]

### Approach
- Add a compact headless runner using the existing integration capture pattern. Render the parent protocol, record camera/browser/renderer metadata and output hashes, preserve per-case results on failure, and write bulk output outside the checkout by default.
- Draw and record the 12 fresh seeds per species after initial calibration; run fixed and fresh measurements, capture the required subsets plus all numerical failures, and personally inspect whole-tree/bare/foliage views against references.
- Report each trait and case, separating numeric pass, visual assessment, missing evidence and actual owner feedback. Fix observed mismatches and retain them as regressions; record unresolved failures rather than declaring fidelity complete.
- Recheck Ordinary, Telperion and Laurelin after shared-rule changes, with known historical defects distinguished from new regressions. Record native generation time/count/size costs on the same host; no software-renderer GPU speed claim.
- Document public species selection, seed semantics, profile provenance, CPU-only generation/capture prerequisites and replay commands. Keep source manifest and compact final report durable; wire relevant checks into package scripts and run final integrated gates once.

### Investigation targets
**Required:**
- `tests/browser/integration.mjs` — headless setup and image output
- `tests/browser/migration.mjs:32-110` — fixed capture environment
- `README.md:51-83` — public commands and cost claims
- `tests/migration/README.md` — evidence/replay conventions
- `.flow/evidence/fn8/REPORT.md` — compact evidence pattern
- `package.json` — check entrypoints

### Quick commands
```bash
npm run rust:test
npm run rust:test:wasm
npm test
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
npm run typecheck
npm run build
node tests/browser/integration.mjs
node tests/browser/species.mjs --help
```

## Acceptance
- [ ] All 24 recorded seeds per species have explicit numeric results; required fixed/fresh image sets are inspected against source references.
- [ ] Trait-level evidence supports R3–R6, or outstanding failures remain explicit and prevent task completion; no unearned owner approval is recorded.
- [ ] Ordinary and both Two Trees are checked for shared-rule regressions, with same-host CPU/count/size results and renderer identity reported.
- [ ] Documented CPU-only replay succeeds, or a concrete environment limitation remains unassessed; missing captures never silently pass.
- [ ] Native workspace tests, Wasm checks, harness tests, formatting/clippy, typecheck, build and relevant headless integration all pass; evidence remains compact.
