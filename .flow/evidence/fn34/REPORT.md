# FN34: beech, ash and birch as real species

2026-09-14. Packets, value tables and the fixed/fresh numeric protocol for
European beech and silver birch. European ash has a complete profile and
reference set; its template waits for fn-33. Visual verdicts are unassessed.
`owner_feedback` is null. This report does not award a visual pass.

Raw 24-seed receipts live on disk under `.flow/evidence/fn34/measure/`
(about 106 MB) and are not committed. The compact table is
`numeric-summary.json`. Reference rasters are under ignored `.refs/fn34/`.

## What changed

Two catalogue presets, `european-beech` and `silver-birch`, are value tables
in `crates/telperion-core/src/presets/species.rs`. Materials sit beside the
oak and spruce rows. Growth traits are the oak's; age is 120 yr (beech,
32 m envelope) and 70 yr (birch, 18 m envelope) so the profile's mature
reference height is the envelope. No generator or renderer code changed.

Ash is gathered in `.flow/evidence/fn34/european-ash/`. No ash preset
exists in the source; the template is written once fn-33 ships compound
leaves. A simple-blade ash is not a pass (R4).

## Numeric protocol

Seeds drawn once with `--draw-seeds` to `.flow/evidence/fn34/seeds.json`
at commit `3468ef710a6f67009c912ffd8c6f7076c5f3771b`, before the full
48-case run. Fixed list is the fn-9 twelve. Fresh seeds were not resampled.

`npm run species:measure -- --profiles .flow/evidence/fn34/profiles.json --seeds .flow/evidence/fn34/seeds.json --output .flow/evidence/fn34/measure`

Capture half (`npm run species:qa -- --capture-only` on the same profiles, seeds and output): every required still wrote a PNG. The runner exited 1 with every `visual_status` unassessed, which is the designed exit. Extra protocol stills (leaf views, first three fresh seeds, ordinary/telperion/laurelin at seed 1) stay under ignored `measure/` and are not the judging set.

| Species | Cases | Numeric | Height m | DBH m (proxy) | Crown width m | Retained failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| european-beech | 24 | 24 pass | 29.98–31.85 | 0.874 | 31.23–32.03 | none |
| silver-birch | 24 | 24 pass | 14.09–15.45 | 0.345 | 12.48–13.72 | none |
| european-ash | not run | unready | — | — | — | waits for fn-33 |

Gating metrics that passed on every seed: height, foliage length, foliage
width; beech also gates DBH. Crown width and crown-base stay contextual.

## Stills

Owner judging set: fixed seeds 1, 2, 3; views `whole` and `bare`; 960×720;
headless on an RTX 3080. Files in `.flow/evidence/fn34/stills/`, hashes in
`stills.json`. Every `visual_status` is `unassessed`. `owner_feedback` is
null. The implementer did not open the rasters (four-images reading rule).

| File | Preset | Seed | View |

| stills/european-beech-1-bare.png | european-beech | 1 | bare |
| stills/european-beech-2-whole.png | european-beech | 2 | whole |

## Ash

Profile, references and a closed-schema `species.json` are complete.
Required capability `pinnate-compound` is unmet. The fixture is not a
catalogue species and was not measured or rendered as a passing tree.

## Undecided / owner

- Visual verdicts on the twelve stills (R3). The spec closes only on
  accepting owner verdicts.
- Ash template after fn-33 lands: leaflet count 7–13, whole-leaf length
  0.20–0.30 m, placements vs instances.
- Growth-trait calibration through time waits for fn-30's method. Height
  by age is recorded on each ready profile.
- `tests/crown_reference.rs` is an ignored FN6 pin list and does not
  include oak or spruce; it was not extended.

## Round 2: matched stills (2026-09-14, fn-36)

The owner rejected round 1 because the fixed views made the comparison unfair
before it was made. Round 2 renders the first fixed seed of each species
through the camera, sun, foliage state and aspect recorded on every whole,
bare and base reference (the `shot` block in `references.json`), without the
scale figure, and pairs each still with its photograph at one height. The
compare script measures both images the same way. Pairs and stills stay on
disk under the ignored `measure/pairs/` directory; `round2/stills.json` records
each by sha256 and `round2/*-compare.json` carries the numbers.

Photograph / still, per reference:

| Reference | Foliage | Width over height | Crown base | Fill | Occupied | Centre order |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-BARE | hidden | 0.74 / 0.69 | 0.25 / 0.26 | 0.90 / 0.96 | 0.28 / 0.31 | RGB / BGR |
| B-BASE | hidden | 0.60 / 0.67 | 1.00 / 0.04 | 1.00 / 1.00 | 0.05 / 0.10 | BRG / BGR |
| B-WHOLE | leaf-on | 0.70 / 0.69 | 0.12 / 0.09 | 0.91 / 0.96 | 0.46 / 0.55 | GBR / GBR |
| S-BARE | hidden | 0.70 / 0.72 | 0.15 / 0.25 | 0.95 / 0.93 | 0.46 / 0.22 | RGB / BGR |
| S-BARK | hidden | 1.07 / 0.90 | 1.00 / 0.00 | 1.00 / 1.00 | 0.47 / 0.43 | GRB / GRB |
| S-WHOLE | leaf-on | 0.85 / 0.88 | 0.08 / 0.21 | 0.96 / 0.94 | 0.44 / 0.40 | GRB / BGR |

How to read the columns: width over height and crown base come from the
photograph's tree box and crown base read by eye, and from the still's tree
mask (what stands out of the row background under the shot's sun and under
the twin's horizon sun). Fill is the tree's height over the frame's; the
still overfills by a few percent because the camera frames the crown's
inscribed ellipsoid, not its silhouette. Occupied is the dark-pixel share of
the photograph's box against the mask's share of the still's, so it is a
density proxy that the photograph's background contaminates on the bare and
base shots. Centre order is the fn-29 channel order of the tree's middle.

What the pairs show, read by the host on the two whole pairs (the four-image
rule): the framing now agrees to within a few percent on proportion, so what
is left is the tree. The beech's crown reads as a scatter of small leaves on
visible straight branches where the photograph is one dense continuous mass;
its trunk is thicker and shorter than the beech's and reads blue-grey under
the overcast sky. The birch is a single upright stem with a rounded crown
where the photograph is two leaning stems with a weeping curtain of long
shoots reaching almost to the ground; the crown base measures 0.21 against
the photograph's 0.08 for that reason. Neither species has the density or
the habit of its photograph yet. No visual pass is awarded here; the owner
judges the pairs.
